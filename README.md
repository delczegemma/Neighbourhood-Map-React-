## Description

The Neigbourhood map is a project provided for Udacity-students. This application uses the Google maps and foursquare API to show the user some interesting place, wich I can recommend from the world. 
Budapest along with Vienna was back in about 100 hundred years ago the city of coffeehouses. Loads of artits and poets gained inspiraton from the pleasent environment and the surrounding community of these institutions.
Among the ruins of city center you can find the reminiscence of these places along with the new wave venue services. I gathered here the best coffehouses based on my on 10 years of expereience.  

## Project Instructions

This is the final Udacity project in the Front-End Nanodegree Program. The main goal was, to build an application from scratch, using all the learned techniques, tools, API-s,  frameworks, and materials and with the freedom of the variety of sultions. In order to see how the application work, you will need Node.js installled in your device. You probably have, but in case you not, [from here](https://nodejs.org/en/) you can download the latest version. 

## Installation

1. Open command line and navigate with it in the project's main folder
2. install all project dependencies with `npm install`
3. start the development server with `npm start`
4. If there is everything in order the app will open automatically in your browser. Probably at the address `localhost:3000` but if it's taken, you will geta message and you can choose an another URL.

## Production mode

A service worker caches all requests in production mode. This is, how to run the app in production mode. You will need to install Python for this. 
1. Open command line and navigate with it in the project's main folder
2. Type `npm run build`
3. cd into the `/build` directory
4. Run localhost server: `python -m http.server <port number>`
5. Open the the page in your browser with the localhost port
